## Overview

EvilPuppet is a proof-of-concept man-in-the-middle(MITM) tool that uses Puppeteer in the background to capture and stream HTML content to a target browser. More than just streaming, it provides an interface that allows the target browser to remotely control the Puppeteer browser instance, simulating a real user's actions.

## Features

- Stream Puppeteer controlled web content to target browsers.
- Allow remote control of the Puppeteer browser instance from the target browser.
- Simulate real user behaviors like clicking, scrolling, and typing.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nexon33/EvilPuppetJS.git
```
2. Navigate into the directory:
```bash
cd EvilPuppetJS
```
3. Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Set config inside config.js

2. Start the server:
```bash
node app.js
```

3. Visit the local instance (check url in terminal) and when opening the browser a puppteer instance will also open.

## Known problems

 - Syncing the textfields between the browsers can be improved.

 - diffDOM library issues which end up also being EvilPuppet's problems.

 - Many other things too much to list for now.

## TODO

 - Make use of MutationObserver instead of a loop to detect changes. (Maybe getting rid of diffDOM?)

 - Improve syncing between text fields.
 
 - Further improve typing 

 - Add support for copy/paste and autofill

 - Complete refactoring the code and convert it to typescript.

 - Add mouse hover and drag.

 - fix the cssparser and html parser to make it more robust in edgecases. Especially get rid of regex.

 - Fix clicking and other functions inside iframes. (only rendering currently works)

 - ...
